PlainClipboardText is an AppleScript app that automatically converts the contents of the clipboard to plain text.

A menu provides options for temporarily disabling it, and for setting the interval in which it makes the conversion.

The only reason to download it is to study its menu techniques (changing the icon when disabled/enabled, etc.).
A far better app for converting the clipboard to plain text is the Pure Paste, available on the App Store.
